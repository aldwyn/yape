For completion on May 2, 2014 6pm:

1. Implement Sleeping Barber problem using semaphore.

Constraints:
1. There is only 1 barber.
2. The barber can only service 1 customer at a time.
3. Customers have priorities(FIFO).
4. The barber shop waiting lounge can only accomodate a limited number of customers.
5. A customer in the waiting lounge is allowed to leave
6. Because of different hair and styling conditions, the service time varies.

To end the simulation, designate a customer to be the last customer. After the barber services 
this customer, the simulation ends. This is called the poison-pill approach.

Use the logging module to log the simulation.

Do not use the built in Python queue. Implement your own queue.

2. Modify your scraper application to include the ff requirements (aside from comments you received):
a. use a pool of threads to fetch, extact, and save data
b. keywords have priorities (FIFO)
c. replace the custom file storing routine with Python logging

Do not use the built in Python queue. Implement your own queue
Use the poison-pill approach to gracefully end your threads

3. Modification to Dining Philosopher implementation.
